(a) The pros of agile development are : 
        1)  Collaborating with the customers to help match their wants/needs (specifications) 
        2)  Breaking down task into smaller iterative steps to make the project easier to approach
    The cons of agile development are: 
        1)  More resilient to changes in the project meaning more work for the engineers 
        2)  Takes more time to finish the project because incremental cycle of development, testing and feedbacks are introduced in every steps
